# System Programming

- This repository contains my homeworks for GTU System Programming Spring 2022.

## HW1: File I/O
- The goal is to develop a simple text editor accomplishing a common task: string replacement.
- The program might be executed as multiple instances with different replacement commands, on the same file. This will result in multiple processes manipulating the same input file with potentially wrong results. You must protect file access by making sure than no second instance of the program runs on the same file, before the first one has finished its task with it.
- Low-level system calls and not C library functions.

### Results
- My report is in the hw1_reports pdf.
